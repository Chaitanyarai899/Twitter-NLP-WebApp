# Twitter-NLP-WebApp

This a webApp that analysis tweets by extracting them through twitter's API. The tweets are catogarized as positive, negative or neutral using natural language processing.
This app is build with streamlit, pandas, numpy, tweepy and some other commonly used python modules.
The webApp is live at this link: https://twitternlpwebapp.onrender.com

## Unfortunate Update
My twitter API access was revoked recently as twitter API V2 became a paid service. Now, in order to fetch tweets from the twitter API I'll have to spend $100 dollars a month
which is just not practical for a full-time student.
Sadly, the webApp is not working anymore.
